# Algorithm-Assisted Localization of Exceptional Points in Reservoir-Coupled Polariton Condensates

This section investigates the localization of exceptional points (EPs) in reservoir-coupled polariton condensates, leveraging PHOENIX's computational efficiency. Exceptional points are singularities in non-Hermitian systems where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, enabling unique phenomena like loss-induced transparency and unidirectional invisibility. These points, particularly in nonlinear systems, present challenges for precise localization due to the coupling of mode gain, loss, and energy through nonlinearities.

A second-order exceptional point is studied in a double-well potential described by:

$$
V(x, y) = V_1 f(x_1, w_v) + V_2 f(x_2, w_v),
$$

where the envelope function is:

$$
f(x_\text{shift}, w) = \exp\left(-\frac{(x-x_\text{shift})^2 + y^2}{w^2}\right)^2.
$$

The well depths are $V_1 = -2.2~\text{meV}$ and $V_2 = -2.0~\text{meV}$, with a separation of $d = 4~\mu\text{m}$ and a well radius $w_v = 1.5~\mu\text{m}$. Nonresonant excitation is applied via a Gaussian-shaped pump:

$$
P(x, y) = P_1 f(x_1, w_p) + P_2 f(x_2, w_p),
$$

where $w_p = 1~\mu\text{m}$ and pump intensities are $P_1 = 12~\text{ps}^{-1}\mu\text{m}^{-2}$ (left) and $P_2$ (right, variable). 

By gradually increasing $P_2$, the exceptional point is traced, showcasing condensation dynamics, mode energy bifurcation, and the characteristic condensation switch-off near the EP. The EP is automatically localized using MATLABâ€™s one-dimensional optimizer on the interval $P_2 = [0, 20]~\text{ps}^{-1}\mu\text{m}^{-2}$. Iterations converge to the EP, minimizing the integrated density in the system, a process completed in approximately one hour with GPU acceleration.
